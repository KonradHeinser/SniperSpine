The vanilla piercing spine felt pretty useless to me. If the enemy is that close, then somebody is charging at somebody. Ranged abilities are going to become moot very quickly, usually before I can even finish shooting a single spine. This mod fixes that by increasing the range to 45 tiles, which is the same as a sniper rifle. Now you can live out your sniping vampire dreams. Until you run out of hemogen within 4 shots.
